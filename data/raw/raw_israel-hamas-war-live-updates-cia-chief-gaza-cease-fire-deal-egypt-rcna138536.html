The resolution calls for a full end of hostilities at the shared border between Israel and Lebanon. \n\n\"When the aggression against Gaza stops, the shooting in the south will stop, and when the shooting stops in Gaza and the Zionist enemy takes any action, we will return to working on the rules and equations that were in place,\" Nasrallah said. \"The resistance’s job is to deter the enemy, and our responses will be proportionate.\" \n\nHezbollah is an Iran-backed militant group that rose following Israel's invasion of Lebanon in 1982 and has become a prominent political party in the country. The group began firing at northern Israel shortly after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack and Israel's declaration of war, resuming a fight that has largely remained quiet since Israel and Hezbollah went to war in 2006. \n\nInternational powers have voiced concerns over the conflict at the border and hope to avoid a larger regional war. Israeli leaders have said they are ready to go to war against Hezbollah if international powers fail to get the group to abide by the longstanding U.N. resolution. \n\nNasrallah accused Western envoys who have tried to deter Hezbollah’s attacks as solely focusing on Israel’s needs. He said the diplomats who have come do not address “any matter related to what is happening in Gaza in terms of aggression, crimes, famine.”"},{"@context":"https://schema.org/","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"NewsMediaOrganization","name":"NBC News","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/h_60/v1696280688/newsgroup-logos/nbcnews/logo/primary-black-424x45.png"},"sameAs":["https://twitter.com/nbcnews","https://pinterest.com/nbcnews","https://www.facebook.com/nbcnews","https://www.instagram.com/nbcnews","https://www.youtube.com/nbcnews","https://www.snapchat.com/discover/Stay_Tuned/7006800740"]},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/live-blog/israel-hamas-war-live-updates-cia-chief-gaza-cease-fire-deal-egypt-rcna138536#rcrd33982"},"headline":"IDF tanks cross the border with Gaza","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/live-blog/israel-hamas-war-live-updates-cia-chief-gaza-cease-fire-deal-egypt-rcna138536#rcrd33982","datePublished":"2024-02-13T15:58:54.409Z","dateModified":"2024-02-13T15:59:39.060Z","author":[{"@context":"https://schema.org/","@type":"Person","name":"Max Butterworth ","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2023_23/3610361/max-headshot.jpg","jobTitle":null,"description":"Max Butterworth is a Photo Editor for NBC News based in London."}],"image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-02/240213-gaza-idf-mb-0857-315ea2.jpg","articleBody":"Tanks crossed the border between southern Israel and northern Gaza today as fierce fighting continues in the southern part of the Palestinian territory."},{"@context":"https://schema.org/","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"NewsMediaOrganization","name":"NBC News","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/h_60/v1696280688/newsgroup-logos/nbcnews/logo/primary-black-424x45.png"},"sameAs":["https://twitter.com/nbcnews","https://pinterest.com/nbcnews","https://www.facebook.com/nbcnews","https://www.instagram.com/nbcnews","https://www.youtube.com/nbcnews","https://www.snapchat.com/discover/Stay_Tuned/7006800740"]},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/live-blog/israel-hamas-war-live-updates-cia-chief-gaza-cease-fire-deal-egypt-rcna138536#rcrd33972"},"headline":"UNGA president warns ‘another phase of this humanitarian catastrophe is at our doorstep’  ","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/live-blog/israel-hamas-war-live-updates-cia-chief-gaza-cease-fire-deal-egypt-rcna138536#rcrd33972","datePublished":"2024-02-13T15:57:38.629Z","dateModified":"2024-02-13T15:57:38.629Z","author":[{"@context":"https://schema.org/","@type":"Person","name":"Mithil Aggarwal","image":null,"jobTitle":null,"description":"Mithil Aggarwal is a Hong Kong-based reporter/producer for NBC News.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/author/mithil-aggarwal-ncpn1288084","sameAs":["https://twitter.com/mithilagg"]}],"image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-02/240213-gaza-idf-mb-0857-315ea2.jpg","articleBody":"As Israel escalates its campaign in the southernmost city of Rafah, the United Nations General Assembly President Dennis Francis said, \"another phase of this humanitarian catastrophe is at our doorstep.\"\n\n\"I am deeply distressed by the escalating military operation into Rafah,\" he wrote on X last night, calling on \"those with leverage\" to help stop Israel's bloody military campaign."},{"@context":"https://schema.org/","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"NewsMediaOrganization","name":"NBC News","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/h_60/v1696280688/newsgroup-logos/nbcnews/logo/primary-black-424x45.png"},"sameAs":["https://twitter.com/nbcnews","https://pinterest.com/nbcnews","https://www.facebook.com/nbcnews","https://www.instagram.com/nbcnews","https://www.youtube.com/nbcnews","https://www.snapchat.com/discover/Stay_Tuned/7006800740"]},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/live-blog/israel-hamas-war-live-updates-cia-chief-gaza-cease-fire-deal-egypt-rcna138536#rcrd34002"},"headline":"IDF says it has arrested Hamas leader in West Bank","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/live-blog/israel-hamas-war-live-updates-cia-chief-gaza-cease-fire-deal-egypt-rcna138536#rcrd34002","datePublished":"2024-02-13T15:56:13.582Z","dateModified":"2024-02-13T16:42:23.261Z","author":[{"@context":"https://schema.org/","@type":"Person","name":"Doha Madani","image":null,"jobTitle":null,"description":"Doha Madani is a senior breaking news reporter for NBC News.

They started the ground operation.’ I was crying. We were screaming,” she said, adding that they “were saying prayers every second so that if we died, you know, we can go to God. To paradise, directly.”\n\nQudeh said it felt as if the strikes lasted for an hour. In a video she took in the dark of the night, the sound of a helicopter can be heard before a blast rings out. \n\nA screenshot of video’s metadata appears to show it was taken at 1:58 a.m. local time (6:58 p.m. ET Sunday). That was around eight minutes after the time the Israel Defense Forces said aerial fire had been launched. \n\nIDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari said yesterday that the strikes were carried out as part of the effort to rescue two men held hostage in Rafah, Fernando Marman, 60, and Louis Har, 70. \n\nPalestinian health authorities said at least 67 people were killed. An NBC News crew on the ground witnessed some of the victims, including children, being brought to the Kuwait Hospital in Rafah.\n\nThe IDF said it could not confirm statistics provided by Palestinian health authorities as it does not find them \"reliable.\"\n\nBefore the war, Qudeh said she enjoyed posting videos on YouTube about her everyday life. In one of her videos published in August, she took her viewers shopping for school supplies with her. In another, she showed fans her routine during the summer holidays, including working out, enjoying a meal and  shopping for clothes and homeware. \n\nAfter she fled her home in Gaza City in northern Gaza with her family, she has posted videos showing the reality of life on the ground in the Strip.

The CIA director and officials from Qatar, Israel and Egypt were present but no representatives from Hamas were at the table. That meeting led to a framework agreement that proposed a temporary pause in the fighting in return for the release of some hostages.\n\nHamas responded to that framework last week during Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s trip to the Middle East. In its response, the militant group called for an end to the war and the withdrawal of all Israeli troops from Gaza. \n\n“We thought there was a formula, not a binding agreement, but a formula that was agreed in Paris,” the Israeli official said. “Then what Hamas sent back was just a revision of some hard-line positions and totally divorced from what was negotiated in Paris.”"},{"@context":"https://schema.org/","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"NewsMediaOrganization","name":"NBC News","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/h_60/v1696280688/newsgroup-logos/nbcnews/logo/primary-black-424x45.png"},"sameAs":["https://twitter.com/nbcnews","https://pinterest.com/nbcnews","https://www.facebook.com/nbcnews","https://www.instagram.com/nbcnews","https://www.youtube.com/nbcnews","https://www.snapchat.com/discover/Stay_Tuned/7006800740"]},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/live-blog/israel-hamas-war-live-updates-cia-chief-gaza-cease-fire-deal-egypt-rcna138536#rcrd33960"},"headline":"ICC prosecutor ‘deeply concerned’ by situation in Gaza’s Rafah ","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/live-blog/israel-hamas-war-live-updates-cia-chief-gaza-cease-fire-deal-egypt-rcna138536#rcrd33960","datePublished":"2024-02-13T09:50:37.346Z","dateModified":"2024-02-13T11:05:16.793Z","author":[{"@context":"https://schema.org/","@type":"Person","name":"Reuters","image":null,"jobTitle":null}],"image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-02/240213-gaza-idf-mb-0857-315ea2.jpg","articleBody":"THE HAGUE — International Criminal Court prosecutor Karim Khan said he was deeply concerned about reports of bombardment and a potential ground incursion by Israeli forces in the southern Gaza city of Rafah.\n\nKhan posted on X after airstrikes in the city that is the last refuge of about a million displaced civilians.\n\nHe said that the court was “actively investigating any crimes allegedly committed” in Gaza and that “those who are in breach of the law will be held accountable.”\n\nHe later told Reuters that half of the population of Gaza is concentrated around Rafah, “reportedly six times its normal concentration.”\n\n“When you have a population that is 60% children and women by all accounts, the risks to civilians are profound,” he said.\n\n“This situation is one that I give the utmost priority to.

David Barnea, director of Israel’s Mossad intelligence agency, will also travel to the Egyptian capital, a senior Israeli official told NBC News. Israel has rejected Hamas&#x27; terms for a deal and the official said the Israeli side is not &quot;optimistic&quot; this time around. President Joe Biden discussed the deal with Jordan&#x27;s King Abdullah II yesterday at the White House, in his first meeting in Washington with an Arab leader since Oct. 7. Both leaders criticized Israel&#x27;s plan to launch a ground offensive in Gaza&#x27;s southernmost city, Rafah, where, Biden said, more than a million &#x27;&#x27;exposed and vulnerable&#x27;&#x27; displaced people are sheltering.  State Department spokesperson Matt Miller said that despite growing tensions between Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the U.S. would not withhold millions in military aid to Israel over humanitarian concerns about the Gaza offensive. The Senate passed a $95 billion national security package that includes aid for Israel.  More than 28,400 people have been killed in Gaza since the war began, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. More than 68,000 have been injured, and thousands more are missing and presumed dead.  Israeli military officials said at least 224 soldiers have been killed during the ground invasion of Gaza.  NBC News’ Raf Sanchez, Molly Hunter and Chantal Da Silva are reporting from the region. "}</script><meta name="description" content="CIA chief negotiates ceasefire deal in Cairo.

And if instructed, we will operate in accordance to it," Lerner said. "I think it’s important to stress that throughout this war, we have conducted evacuation efforts from north to south, from within the south, to different areas." </p><p class="">Israeli officials say Rafah is Hamas’ last stronghold inside of the Palestinian enclave. </p><p class="">Aid organizations and U.S. officials have expressed concerns that Israel's military campaign moving into Rafah will risk the lives of more than 1 million civilians. The population of the border city has dramatically increased since Oct. 7, with many forced out of their homes and displaced multiple times by violence as Israel's military campaign worked its way to south Gaza. </p><p class="">When asked whether there is anywhere for these civilians to go, Lerner responded, "where there is a will, there is a way."  </p><p class="">"If people want to stay alive, they need to evacuate when they're instructed to evacuate," Lerner said. </p><div class="styles_hidden-show-more-content__37qyQ"></div></div></div><div class="styles_chat-blog-card__nFL_J article-body__content w-100 mh0 fn" id="rcrd34006" data-testid="chat-card-container"><div class="styles_time-stamp-social-share-container__zWQeJ"><div class="styles_chatCardTimestamp__Lhru2 styles_eventEnded__gIoTG"><div class="styles_timestamp__dS4G7 styles_chatStyleTimeStamp__7lmh7" data-testid="timestamp">28d ago / 5:17 PM UTC</div></div><button class="social-share-button" type="button" data-testid="chat-card-social-share-button" aria-expanded="false" aria-label="open social share icon list"><img alt="social share icon trigger" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,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" height="30" width="30"/></button></div><h2 class="styles_chartCardHeadline__aiJF0" data-testid="chat-card-headline">9-year-old disabled orphan who fled to southern Gaza dies</h2><div class="styles_authors-container__IX4r8"><div class="styles_chatCartByline__ivtPj" data-testid="chat-card-byline-container"><div class="byline-thumbnail byline-thumbnail--has-image styles_bylineThumbnail___nR29" data-testid="byline-thumbnail"><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/author/yasmine-salam-ncpn1240872"><picture data-testid="picture"><source srcSet="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/newscms/2020_39/3414656/img_0538.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2020_39/3414656/img_0538.jpg 1x"/><img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2020_39/3414656/img_0538.jpg" alt="" height="48" width="48"/></picture></a></div><div class="styles_inner__ukqsN"><p class="styles_authors__quDSP" data-testid="chat-card-byline"><span class="styles_chat-card-byline__O7LeR" data-testid="chat-card-byline-name"><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/author/yasmine-salam-ncpn1240872"><span class="styles_chat-card-byline--name__zNjqq">Yasmine Salam</span></a></span></p></div></div></div><div data-icid="live-blog-card-link" data-testid="chat-card-body-container"><p class="">A disabled orphan named Iyas was buried yesterday in a southern Gaza cemetery, his body prayed over by his guardian and a gravedigger. </p><p class="">The 9-year-old boy's guardian was videotaped by an NBC News crew carrying Iyas' body wrapped in a white burial shroud from El Najjer hospital in Rafah to a nearby cemetery, where local workers were seen digging a fresh grave.  </p><p class="">After slabs of concrete were laid over the body and water was mixed into the fresh earth to seal the tomb, Iyas' guardian quickly prayed for the boy, alongside one gravedigger.</p><p class="">The guardian told NBC News the boy had suffered from a lack of maintenance medication for months and was pronounced dead by hospital staff yesterday. </p><p class="">"He had no treatments over a period of 4 months, treatment is in short supply, because of the siege and the war we’re in," the grieving man said.</p><p class="">"The goodbyes were very hard, separations from the child was very hard on his siblings and his family," he added.</p><p class="">NBC News <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/nightly-news/video/war-in-gaza-takes-heavy-toll-on-children-202033733919" target="_blank">previously reported</a> that Iyas was blind and suffered debilitating complex needs, including uncontrollable muscle contractions.

Israeli leaders have said they are ready to go to war against Hezbollah if international powers fail to get the group to abide by the longstanding U.N. resolution. </p><p class="">Nasrallah accused Western envoys who have tried to deter Hezbollah’s attacks as solely focusing on Israel’s needs.

The CIA director and officials from Qatar, Israel and Egypt were present but no representatives from Hamas were at the table.

Richard Engel and Peter Baker join Andrea Mitchell to discuss how President Biden has stepped up his criticism of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. “He said there's a red line, but there's no red line when it comes to continuing to supply Israel with weapons, for example for the Iron Dome system. So, it sounded like he's encouraging Israel more than threatening any kind of dramatic action,” Richard says. “It's a moment where he does face up tension with Netanyahu. But it’s true that there is also widespread support in Israel across the political spectrum, it’s not just Netanyahu, for the military operation there. And so, obviously this personal relationship between the two is fraught,\" Baker adds. "},"publisher":{"name":"msnbc"},"source":{"name":"Andrea Mitchell Reports"},"taxonomy":{"additionalTerms":[{"dateCreated":"Mon Dec 13 2021 04:00:31 GMT+0000 (UTC)","dateModified":"Mon Dec 13 2021 04:00:31 GMT+0000 (UTC)","description":{"primary":null},"id":"nctx22586","isCurated":false,"name":"Andrea Mitchell Reports","path":"nbcnews/show/andrea-mitchell-reports","pageRoute":"/","slug":"andrea-mitchell-reports","type":"taxonomy","taxonomyType":"show","url":{"primary":null}},{"dateCreated":"Thu Mar 17 2022 20:14:47 GMT+0000 (UTC)","dateModified":"Thu Mar 17 2022 20:14:47 GMT+0000 (UTC)","description":{"primary":null},"id":"nctx23722","isCurated":false,"name":"MSNBC Dayside","path":"msnbc/show/msnbc-dayside","pageRoute":"/","slug":"msnbc-dayside","type":"taxonomy","taxonomyType":"show","url":{"primary":null}}],"primaryVertical":{"name":"MSNBC"},"primarySection":null,"primaryTopic":null},"hasCaptions":true,"closedCaptioning":{"smptett":null,"srt":"https://nbcnewsdigital-static.nbcuni.com/media/captions/NBC_News_Digital/2024/03/1710179176338_n_mitchell_engelbakerisrael_240311.srt","webvtt":"https://nbcnewsdigital-static.nbcuni.com/media/captions/NBC_News_Digital/2024/03/1710179176338_n_mitchell_engelbakerisrael_240311.vtt"},"videoAssets":[{"assetType":"EMP","format":"M3U","publicUrl":"https://prodamdnewsencoding.akamaized.net/NBC_News_Digital/n_mitchell_engelbakerisrael_240311/1/abs/index.m3u8","height":1080,"width":1920,"assetDuration":488.192,"bitrate":4074000},{"assetType":"akamaiMp4","format":"MPEG4","publicUrl":"https://prodamdnewsencoding.akamaized.net/NBC_News_Digital/nbcnews/video/2024/03/1710179176338_n_mitchell_engelbakerisrael_240311_6.mp4","height":1080,"width":1920,"assetDuration":488.192,"bitrate":4074827}]},{"type":"video","id":"mmvo206130757962","unibrow":{"logo":null,"taxonomyPath":"msnbc/show/andrea-mitchell","text":"Andrea Mitchell Reports","url":{"primary":"https://www.msnbc.com/andrea-mitchell"}},"mpxMetadata":{"id":"206130757962","guid":"n_mitchell_fmrspecialenvoy_240311","externalAdvertiserId":"n_mitchell_fmrspecialenvoy_240311"},"datePublished":"Mon Mar 11 2024 17:43:04 GMT+0000 (UTC)","dateCreated":"Mon Mar 11 2024 17:43:04 GMT+0000 (UTC)","dateModified":"Mon Mar 11 2024 17:43:54 GMT+0000 (UTC)","primaryImage":{"id":"vidimg3362353943","headline":{"primary":null},"altText":null,"caption":null,"url":{"primary":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/mpx/2704722219/2024_03/1710178963177_n_mitchell_fmrspecialenvoy_240311_1920x1080-7mg2bq.jpg"},"imageUrl":{"aims":"https://media11.s-nbcnews.com/i/mpx/2704722219/2024_03/1710178963177_n_mitchell_fmrspecialenvoy_240311_1920x1080-7mg2bq.jpg","cloudinary":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/mpx/2704722219/2024_03/1710178963177_n_mitchell_fmrspecialenvoy_240311_1920x1080-7mg2bq.jpg","telemundo":null},"source":null,"authors":[],"height":null,"width":null,"graphicContent":false},"teaseImage":{"id":"vidimg3362353943","headline":{"primary":null},"altText":null,"caption":null,"url":{"primary":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/mpx/2704722219/2024_03/1710178963177_n_mitchell_fmrspecialenvoy_240311_1920x1080-7mg2bq.jpg"},"imageUrl":{"aims":"https://media11.s-nbcnews.com/i/mpx/2704722219/2024_03/1710178963177_n_mitchell_fmrspecialenvoy_240311_1920x1080-7mg2bq.jpg","cloudinary":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/mpx/2704722219/2024_03/1710178963177_n_mitchell_fmrspecialenvoy_240311_1920x1080-7mg2bq.jpg","telemundo":null},"source":null,"authors":[],"height":null,"width":null,"graphicContent":false},"url":{"canonical":"https://www.msnbc.com/andrea-mitchell-reports/watch/amb-dan-foote-haitian-pm-ariel-henry-will-not-survive-if-he-returns-to-haiti-206130757962","primary":"https://www.msnbc.com/andrea-mitchell-reports/watch/amb-dan-foote-haitian-pm-ariel-henry-will-not-survive-if-he-returns-to-haiti-206130757962","short":"https://www.msnbc.com/andrea-mitchell-reports/watch/amb-dan-foote-haitian-pm-ariel-henry-will-not-survive-if-he-returns-to-haiti-206130757962","slug":"amb-dan-foote-haitian-pm-ariel-henry-will-not-survive-if-he-returns-to-haiti-206130757962"},"relatedUrl":null,"relatedContentLink":{"text":null,"url":null},"duration":"PT4M26S","nativeAd":false,"videoType":"broadcast","sentiment":"neutral","headline":{"primary":"Amb.
